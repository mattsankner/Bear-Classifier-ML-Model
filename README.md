# Bear-Classifier-with-Gradio-and-FastAI
This repository contains a machine learning model that classifies images of bears. The types of bears it can identify are Polar, Grizzly, Black, and Teddy bears. The model is trained using the FastAI library, and a simple web interface is built using Gradio for users to upload and classify their images.
